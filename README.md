This project is a database-driven, multithreaded client-server application that facilitates data exchange using JSON (via org.json parser) and binary streams. It includes a well-defined communications protocol, a Data Access Layer, and applies key design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Command, Decorator). The system follows DRY principles, incorporates collection classes, and is rigorously tested with unit tests. Comprehensive documentation includes a sequence diagram and a high-level architecture diagram. Version control is actively maintained throughout development.
